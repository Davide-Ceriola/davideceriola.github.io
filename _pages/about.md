I am a PhD Student in Artificial Intelligence at Sapienza University of Rome, under the supervision of Prof. Giorgio Grisetti, working within the Robot Vision and Perception (RVP). \
My research lies at the intersection of probabilistic perception and decentralized optimization. Specifically, I focus on building scalable inference frameworks for Continuous-Time SLAM (CT-SLAM). By leveraging Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) and Gaussian Processes (GP), I develop solvers capable of handling asynchronous, heterogeneous sensor data—such as rolling-shutter cameras and LiDAR—without the bottlenecks of centralized architectures.\
Currently, I am investigating adaptive scheduling mechanisms for distributed factor graphs to improve the convergence speed and numerical stability of decentralized solvers (G-solver) in large-scale, multi-robot environments.
