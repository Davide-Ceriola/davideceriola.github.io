I assist Prof. Giorgio Grisetti in designing and delivering the graduate course *Probabilistic Robotics* at the Department of Computer, Control, and Management Engineering (DIAG). The class focuses on state estimation, factor graphs, and modern inference techniques for autonomous systems.

***Abstract:** The course aims at providing the students with the necessary mathematical background and the practical guidelines to tackle complex problems in state estimation and model identification for robots. At the end of this course the student will possess the necessary background to approach fundamental problems in robotics including, but not limited to localization, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), calibration and tracking.*
